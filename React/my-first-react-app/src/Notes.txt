 ---------
 Component
 --------- 
 1. Unit of UI (HTML + CSS (import)+ JS logic)
 2. React is a JS library
      That meeans we need to codee in javascript
      Which further indicates that all the logic will be written in .js file
 3. Components will be crated in javascript files only.
    Componnets are of two types
      1. Functional Component
      2. Class component

 -------------
 Props & State
 -------------  

 1. Both are related to the the data shown in the UI with the help of component.
 2. Props: 
      Is the data received from the parent component. And it is non modifieable.
      It can be of any data type ranging from primitive types like number, string to non - primitives like object arrays etc.
      Also we can share the functions, component itself as a prop from the parent to child component.
      We can access props using "props" keyword in the functional component and using this.props in the class component.
 3. State: 
      Is the data which we create within the component and it is modofieable.
      State can of be any data type, ranging from numbers, string to arrays and functions.
      We can also assign functions & componens in the state.
      To make a state in functional component, we have a hook named as useState. While in class component, we define all the states inside constructor function of the class.


---------------
Fragment vs Div
---------------
1. Fragment:
   Helps us enclosing adjacent JSX element without creating any additional node in the DOM tree. That means it has no impace on DOM.
   React also exports a Fragment (<Fragment></Fragment>) element that can be used in place of html fragment i.e. <></>
2. Div not only used for enclosing but it is also used for creating and it will be visible in the DOM tree.
